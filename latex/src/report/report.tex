    \section{Introduction} \label{sec:introduction}
    We consider a graph $G = (V, E)$ with a set of terminals $W \subseteq V$, together with a set of valid traffic demands between terminals represented by a matrix $(D_{ij})_{i,j \in W}$.
    We refer to the set of valid demands as the \emph{demand universe} $\mathcal U$.
    The goal in robust network design is to construct a network on $G$ by buying capacities on the edges such that every valid traffic demand can be routed on the network.
    The usual challenge is to minimize the cost of the network, defined by $\sum_{e \in E} c_e x_e$, where $x_e$ denotes the bought capacity for edge $e$, and $c_e$ the per-unit-capacity cost of the edge.

    Although the network needs to be able to route multiple demand matrices, we disallow changing the routing paths between terminals if demands change.
    This is referred to the \emph{oblivious} routing model, where each pair of terminals $i,j \in W$ has a fixed routing path $P_{ij}$ for all routing all demands.
    Hence, for every edge $e$ on the path $P_{ij}$ we must buy a capacity of at least $D_{ij}$, for each demand matrix $D \in \mathcal U$.
    We refer to the set of paths $\mathcal P = \set{P_{ij} : i,j \in W}$ as the \emph{routing template}.
    The routing template, together with the bought capacities for the edges, forms the solution to a robust network design problem.

    Robust network design has been studied on specific classes of demand universes.
    Such as special class are the \emph{hose matrices} $\mathcal H = \set{(D_{ij}) : \sum_j D_{ij} \le b_i \quad \forall_{i \in W}}$, where $b_i$ denotes the \emph{marginal} demand for terminal $i$, that describes the maximum amount of traffic communicated from this terminal.
    The demands are viewed as undirected, hence $D_{ij} = D_{ji}$ describes the single demand between $i,j$.
    Designing a minimum cost network for the class of hose matrices is known as the \emph{virtual private network (VPN) problem}.
    A $2$-approximation algorithm for the VPN problem was shown both in \cite{fingerhut1997designing} and \cite{gupta2001provisioning}.
    It was conjectured \cite{italiano2006design} that this algorithm is in fact optimal.
    The conjecture was initially shown to hold on ring networks (the constrained setting where $G$ is a cycle) and some other special cases~\cite{hurkens2007virtual}, and was later resolved for arbitrary networks as well~\cite{goyal2013vpn}.

    In this report, we consider two other classes of (polyhedral) demand universes.
    We first look into \emph{tree demands}, generalizing the class of hose matrices.
    The robust network design problem for tree demands is known as the \emph{generalized VPN} problem.
    The 2-approximation algorithm for the VPN problem has a natural extension to the generalized case, and it is conjectured that this algorithm is optimal in this setting as well \cite{OLVER2016191}.
    However, this remains unresolved.
    In this report, we discuss this algorithm and discuss some efforts of proving the conjecture on ring networks.
