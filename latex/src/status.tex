    \section{Introduction}

    \section{Implemented algorithms}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Enumeration algorithm, finding the optimal hierarchical hubbing solution.

        Recursive, brute-force algorithm, enumerating all possible mappings $h\colon V_T \to V_G$ (with $h(i) = i$ for all terminals $i \in W$).
        Used to check the dynamic programming algorithm, but is too slow to use for reasonably-sized instances.

        \item Dynamic programming algorithm, finding the optimal hierarchical hubbing solution.

        Based on ``Approximability of Robust Network Design'' by Olver and Shepherd, from the proof of Lemma~3.1.
        The dynamic program only finds the optimal solution \emph{value}, and we construct the actual solution (the mapping $h$, and routing template $\set{P_{ij}}$, and bought capacities $u$) from backtracking the DP table.
        In general, the obtained routing template paths may be non-simple, which we `fix' by removing the cycles explicitly.

        \item Semi-infinite MIP formulation, finding an exact solution.

        MIP formulation using row generation.
        Turns out to be slow, as many row generation iterations are needed to find an optimal solution.

        \item Compact MIP formulation, finding an exact solution.

        MIP formulation where the need for row generation is removed by using a clever dualization trick, as described in ``Provisioning Virtual Private Networks under Traffic Uncertainty'' by Alt\i{}n, Amaldi, Belotti and P\i{}nar.

        Using the solution from the DP algorithm, we have attempted to warm start the MIP by providing this solution to the solver.
        However, it seems to be the case this solution is sometimes not used by the solver, but sometimes it speeds up the solving process.
        We have not been able to find (yet) why the solver is not able to do something with the provided solution.

        Both MIP formulations are implemented using Gurobi.

    \section{Experiments}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Petersen graph
        \begin{itemize}
            \item All ($68\,185$) instances with:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Unit cost on the edges in $G$,
                \item All possible choices for which nodes in $G$ are a terminal ($\sim 2^{10}$),
                \item All possible \emph{two-union star} trees as the demand tree, with unit capacity on the edges incident to a terminal, and all (relevant) choices for the bridge cost.
                \item For all cases, the LP relaxation has the same objective value as the optimal integer solution.
                In almost all cases, the LP relaxation solution was integral.
            \end{itemize}
