    Let $G = (V, E)$ be a graph with with edge costs $c\colon E \to \mathbb R_+$, describing a network.
    Let $W \subseteq V$ be a set of terminals.
    Let $\mathcal U$ describe the universe of symmetric demand matrices $(D_{ij})_{i,j \in W}$ (we require that $D_{ii} = 0$ for all $i \in W$), describing the amount of traffic between two terminals.

    We consider a specific universe of demands, called the \emph{capped hose model}.
    We can describe the capped hose model is described by a polytope: each terminal $i$ has maximum capacity $b_i$ (as in the hose model), and additionally there is an upper bound $d_{ij}$ on the demand between terminals $i,j \in W$.
    Hence, we can describe the capped hose polytope $\mathcal H^\text{cap}(b, d)$ as all (symmetric) matrices $(D_{ij})_{i,j \in W}$ for which
    \[
        \begin{split}
            \sum_{j \in W} D_{ij} &\le b_i \qquad&&\forall_{i \in W}, \\
            D_{ij} &\le d_{ij} \qquad&&\forall_{i,j \in \binom W 2}.
        \end{split}
    \]
    Note that setting $d_{ij} = 0$ signals that terminals $i$ and $j$ may not communicate.

    We define a graph $H$ with vertex set the terminals $W$ and edges $W \times W$, weighted with $d_{ij}$.
    We will first derive a compact MIP formulation for general RND problems under the capped hose demand model.
    We will then focus on the case where $H$ is a cycle, i.e.\ terminals are only allowed to communicate with its two direct neighbors in the cycle.
    In this case, a dynamic programming algorithm is suggested by Bosman and Olver, for which it remains open whether it is optimal (for arbitrary $b$ and $d$).

    \section{MIP formulation}
    As for the VPN and generalized VPN problem, we first write the semi-infinite MIP formulation with the row generation subproblems.
    We then use a dualization trick to obtain a compact formulation.

    Let $x_{uv}$ denote the amount of capacity we buy of edge $\{u,v\}$ in the network graph $G$.
    The semi-infinite MIP formulation (the master problem) becomes
    \begin{alignat*}{5}
        \text{minimize}\ && \sum_{uv \in E} c_{uv} \cdot x_{uv} &&& \\
        \text{subject to}\ && x_{uv} &\ge \sum_{ij \in \binom{W}{2}} D_{ij} \cdot (f_{uv}^{ij} + f_{vu}^{ij}) &&\qquad \forall_{uv \in E,\ D \in \mathcal U^*} \\
        && \sum_{uv \in \delta(u)} f_{uv}^{ij} - f_{vu}^{ij} &= \begin{cases}
                                     1 & \text{if $u = i$} \\
                                     -1 & \text{if $u = j$} \\
                                     0 & \text{otherwise}
        \end{cases} &&\qquad \forall_{u \in V,\ ij \in \binom{W}{2}} \\
        && x_{uv} &\in \mathbb{R}_+ &&\qquad \forall_{uv \in E} \\
        && f_{uv}^{ij},\ f_{vu}^{ij} &\in \{ 0, 1 \} &&\qquad \forall_{uv \in E,\ ij \in \binom{W}{2}}
    \end{alignat*}
    where $\mathcal U^* \subseteq \mathcal H^\text{cap}(b, d)$, and is populated by solving the following row generation subproblems (for all $uv \in E$).
    Let $(\tilde x, \tilde f)$ denote the current optimal solution of the master problem.
    \begin{alignat*}{5}
        \text{maximize}\quad && \sum_{ij \in \binom{W}{2}} (\tilde f_{uv}^{ij} + \tilde f_{vu}^{ij}) \cdot D_{ij} &&& \\
        \text{subject to}\quad && D_{ij} &\le d_{ij} &&\qquad \forall_{ij \in \binom W 2} \\
        && \sum_{\substack{j \in W:\\i \neq j}} D_{ij} &\le b_i &&\qquad \forall_{i \in W} \\
        && D_{ij} &\in \mathbb{R}_+ &&\qquad \forall_{ij \in \binom{W}{2}}
    \end{alignat*}
    Let $D^*$ denote the optimal solution of the above row generation subproblem.
    If the objective of $D^*$ violates the constraint in the master problem (when its greater than $\tilde x_{uv}$), then we add $D^*$ to $\mathcal U^*$.

    \subsection{Compact formulation}
    To obtain the compact formulation, we dualize the subproblems.
    Fix an edge $uv \in E$.
    We introduce dual variables: $\psi_{ij}^{uv}$, for all $ij \in \binom W 2$, for the first constraint, and $\omega_i^{uv}$ for all $i \in \binom W 2$, for the second constraint.
    We then get the dual
    \begin{alignat*}{5}
        \text{minimize}\quad && \sum_{ij \in \binom{W}{2}} d_{ij} \cdot \psi_{ij}^{uv} + \sum_{i \in W} b_i \cdot \omega_i^{uv} &&& \\
        \text{subject to}\quad && \psi_{ij}^{uv} + \omega_i^{uv} + \omega_j^{uv} &\ge f_{uv}^{ij} + f_{vu}^{ij} &&\qquad \forall_{ij \in \binom W 2} \\
        && \psi_{ij}^{uv} &\in \mathbb{R}_+ &&\qquad \forall_{ij \in \binom{W}{2}} \\
        && \omega_i^{uv} &\in \mathbb{R}_+ &&\qquad \forall_{i \in W}
    \end{alignat*}
    Because of strong duality and because $x_{uv}$ appears with nonnegative coefficients in the objective, we can substitute the dual into the master problem to obtain a compact formulation:
    \begin{alignat*}{5}
        \text{minimize}\ && \sum_{uv \in E} c_{uv} \cdot x_{uv} &&& \\
        \text{subject to}\ && x_{uv} &\ge \sum_{ij \in \binom{W}{2}} d_{ij} \cdot \psi_{ij}^{uv} + \sum_{i \in W} b_i \cdot \omega_i^{uv} &&\qquad \forall_{uv \in E} \\
        && \psi_{ij}^{uv} + \omega_i^{uv} + \omega_j^{uv} &\ge f_{uv}^{ij} + f_{vu}^{ij} &&\qquad \forall_{uv \in E,\ ij \in \binom W 2} \\
        && \sum_{uv \in \delta(u)} f_{uv}^{ij} - f_{vu}^{ij} &= \begin{cases}
                                     1 & \text{if $u = i$} \\
                                     -1 & \text{if $u = j$} \\
                                     0 & \text{otherwise}
        \end{cases} &&\qquad \forall_{u \in V,\ ij \in \binom{W}{2}} \\
        && x_{uv} &\in \mathbb{R}_+ &&\qquad \forall_{uv \in E} \\
        && \psi_{ij}^{uv} &\in \mathbb{R}_+ &&\qquad \forall_{uv \in E,\ ij \in \binom{W}{2}} \\
        && \omega_i^{uv} &\in \mathbb{R}_+ &&\qquad \forall_{uv \in E,\ i \in W} \\
        && f_{uv}^{ij},\ f_{vu}^{ij} &\in \{ 0, 1 \} &&\qquad \forall_{uv \in E,\ ij \in \binom{W}{2}}
    \end{alignat*}

    For the specific case where the support of $(d_{ij})$ is a cycle a dynamic programming algorithm is suggested (but it remains open whether it is optimal for arbitrary $b$ and $d$).
    We discuss this algorithm next.

    \section{Dynamic programming formulation}
    In Bosman's and Olver's paper ``Exploring the Tractability of the Capped Hose Model'', a dynamic program is suggested for these circumstances.
    They proved that it is optimal for unit capacities for the edges and vertices in the cycle $H$.
    We will implement this for arbitrary capacities and compare the outcome with the integer program.

    In the first step, the cycle $H$ is modified by adding an extra vertex between each terminal and the cycle.
    The resulting graph is denoted with $\hat H$ and the new vertex adjacent to terminal $v$ in $\hat H$ is denoted with $\hat v$ (see Figure~\ref{fig:hdak}).
    We restrict ourselves to the situation where the capacities are minimal, i.e. cannot be reduced while keeping the problem the same.
    Thus, the capacity of an edge cannot be more than the capacity of an adjacent vertex.
    And the capacity of a vertex cannot be more than the sum of the capacities of the two adjacent edges.

    \begin{figure}
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=.35\textwidth]{hdak.png}
        \caption{The graph $\hat H$.} \label{fig:hdak}
    \end{figure}

    Let the vertices on cycle $H$ be $v_0, v_1, \dots, v_n = v_0$.
    Then the subproblem is defined in the following way: let $C[i, j, h(i), h(j)]$ be the minimum cost of only the part from $i$ to $j$ in $H$ (clockwise), where $\hat v_i$ is mapped to $h(i)$ and $\hat v_j$ is mapped to $h(j)$.
    Here, $0 \le i < j \le n$ and all terminals must be mapped to itself.

    If $j = i + 1$, then the cost is $b_i \cdot d_c(v_i, h(i)) + d_{ij} \cdot d_c(h(i), h(j)) + b_j \cdot d_c(v_j, h(j))$.
    Here, $d_c(u, v)$ is the shortest path under cost function $c$ from $u$ to $v$ in $G$, i.e.\ buying each edge on the shortest path once.
    It is considers the edge $\{\hat v_i, \hat v_j\}$ in the cycle in $\hat H$ and the two edges between these nodes and the corresponding terminals.
    Because we required the capacities to be minimal, we know that there exist valid demands that utilize the full capacity.
    Thus, we must buy these.

    If $j$ is not $i+1$, we pick a node $\hat v_k$ with $i < k < j$ (for example, $k = i + 1$).
    Then, $C[i, j, h(i), h(j)]$ is the minimum over all possible mappings $h(k) \in V_G$ of $C[i, k, h(i), h(k)] + C[k, j, h(k), h(j)] - b_k d(v_k, h(k))$.
    Both parts consider the edge $(v_k, \hat v_k)$, so we should remove it once to obtain the correct answer.
    See also Figure~\ref{fig:dp} for a sketch of the situation.

    \begin{figure}
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=.35\textwidth]{dp.png}
        \caption{Sketch of the situation for the dynamic program (in $\hat H$).} \label{fig:dp}
    \end{figure}

    This leads to the following recurrence:
    \[
        C[i, j, h(i), h(j)] = \begin{cases}
                                  0 &\text{if $i \ge j$} \\
                                  b_i \cdot d_c(v_i, h(i)) + d_{ij} \cdot d_c(h(i), h(j)) + b_j \cdot d_c(v_j, h(j)) &\text{if $j = i+1$}\\
                                  \displaystyle \min_{h(k) \in V_G} \{ C[i, k, h(i), h(k)] + C[k, j, h(k), h(j)] - b_k d(v_k, h(k)) \} &\text{otherwise}\\


        \end{cases}
    \]

    We can now determine all values by first determining the base cases, then all valid intervals of length two, then length three etc.
    The last interval will go from $0$ to $n$ and this is the interval we are interested in.
    The minimum over all mappings $h(0)$ of $C[0, n, h(0), h(0)]$ will be the minimum cost.
    The actual mappings can be obtained by searching the table backwards.

    \section{Generalizing the proof of Bosman and Olver}
    We first try to generalize the proof that we can restrict to integral solutions (in the MIP formulation above).
    That is, we can assume $\omega_i(e)$ and $\psi_{ij}(e)$ are integral.
    Note that here we are slightly adapting the notation from above to match with Bosman and Olver: for an edge $e = \{u, v\}$ we now write $\omega_i(e)$ and $\psi_{ij}(e)$ instead of $\omega_i^{uv}$ and $\psi_{ij}^{uv}$.

    We slightly adapt our view of the problem (B\&O Section~2).
    Our goal is to specify a routing template $\mathcal P = \{ P_{ij} : \{i, j\} \in E(H) \}$, where $H = (W, E(H))$ is the support graph of $d_{ij}$.
    Given a routing template, we can write an expression for the minimum capacity we are required to buy for each edge:
    \[
        u(e) = \max_{D \in \mathcal H^\text{cap}(b, d)} \sum_{\substack{ij \in \binom W 2 :\\e \in P_{ij}}} D_{ij}.
    \]
    The resulting solution has cost $\sum_e c(e) u(e)$, and this we wish to minimize.

    \subsubsection*{Rephrashed version of the problem}
    We can also formulate the dual version of the above, from which we obtain a convenient rephrased version of the problem.
    We thus get the following dual expression, as derived above:
    \[
        \begin{split}
            u(e) = \text{min}\quad & \sum_{i \in W} b_i \omega_i(e) + \sum_{ij \in \binom W 2} d_{ij} \psi_{ij}(e) \\
            \text{s.t.}\quad & \omega_i(e) + \omega_j(e) + \psi_{ij}(e) \ge 1 \qquad \forall_{ij \in E(H) : e \in P_{ij}} \\
            & \omega_i(e),\ \psi_{ij}(e) \ge 0.
        \end{split}
    \]
    We then rephrase the problem as follows.
    Each terminal $i$ buys a capacity vector $\omega_i$, and each connection $ij$ buys a capacity vector $\psi_{ij}$ (indexed by the edges $e \in E$ of $G$), with the property that $\{ e \in E : \omega_i(e) + \omega_j(e) + \psi_{ij}(e) \ge 1 \}$ contains an $i$--$j$-path, for each connection $ij \in E(H)$.
    The goal is to minimize the total cost
    \[
        \sum_{e \in E} c(e) u(e) = \sum_{i} b_i c(\omega_i) + \sum_{ij} d_{ij} c(\psi_{ij}),
    \]
    where $c(\omega_i) = \sum_{e \in E} c(e) \omega_i(e)$ and $c(\psi_{ij}) = \sum_{e \in E} c(e) \psi_{ij}(e)$ (one can verify the total cost expression by substituting the dual objective for $u(e)$, merging the ``min''s, and re-arranging the summations).

    \subsubsection*{Integral solutions}
    We will show that Lemma~4 of B\&O generalizes to our case, i.e.\ that we can restrict to integral capacity vectors $(\boldsymbol \omega, \boldsymbol \psi)$.
    \begin{proof}
        First, note that in any optimal, possibly fractional, solution, we have that $0 \le \omega_i, \psi_{ij} \le 1$, by the nature of the dual formulation.
        Hence, if the solution is integral, we know that the capacity vectors are binary.
        It is convenient to express the solution as a collection of edge sets (which we denote with a capital letter) $\boldsymbol \Omega = (\Omega_i)$ and $\boldsymbol \Psi = (\Psi_{ij})$, where $\Omega_i = \{ e : \omega_i(e) = 1 \}$ and $\Psi_{ij} = \{ e : \psi_{ij}(e) = 1 \}$, i.e.\ the edges that each terminal/connection buys.

        We now assume that $H$ is a cycle, and show that there always exists an integral optimum solution to the capped hose problem.
        Notice that $u(e)$ is phrased as a fractional $d$-capacitated $b$-matching problem on $H$, which has an integral optimal solution if $H$ is bipartite (since the constraint matrix is the incidence matrix of $H$, which is totally unimodular, see also Schrijver Thm~21.8).
        Hence, if $H$ is an even cycle, it is bipartite and we are done.

        Now, consider the case when $H$ is an odd cycle.
        Since any strict subgraph of a cycle is bipartite, the only case where we do not have an integral optimal solution is when $u(e)$ corresponds to the dual $d$-capacitated $b$-matching problem on the complete cycle.
        This only happens if the routing path between \emph{every} pair of neighbors uses the edge.

        So suppose $e = \{u, v\}$ is used on every routing path $P_{ij} \in \mathcal P$.
        Let $(\boldsymbol \omega, \boldsymbol \psi)$ a (possibly fractional) dual solution, with corresponding primal solution $D$.
        We first assume that this solution saturates $b$, i.e.\ the optimal primal solution $D$ satisfies
        \[
            D_{i-1,i} + D_{i,i+1} = b_i
        \]
        for all $i \in W$.
        We claim that the integral solution $(\boldsymbol Y, \boldsymbol Z)$, given by:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item taking $Y_i$ to be the set of edges of a shortest $i$--$v$-path (for all terminals $i$),
            \item taking $Z_{ij} = \varnothing$,
        \end{itemize}
        costs no more than $(\boldsymbol \omega, \boldsymbol \psi)$.

        The following closely resembles the arguments from B\&O\@.
        We let $D$ be the traffic matrix from the primal solution.
        If we now route $D$ according to $(\boldsymbol \omega, \boldsymbol \psi)$, the flow between $i$ and $i+1$ can be split into flow between $i$--$v$ and flow between $v$--$(i+1)$, since every routing path passes through $e$, and thus through $v$.

        So $D$ induces a $i$--$v$ flow for each $i \in W$ of at least $b_i$, following directly from the fact that $b$ is saturated.
        So $(\boldsymbol \omega, \boldsymbol \psi)$ has sufficient capacity to route $b_i$ unit of flow from each $i \in W$ simultaneously.
        This costs at least as much as buying $b_i$ of every edge on a shortest path from terminal $i$ to $v$, for all terminals.
        The latter is exactly the cost of the integral solution $(\boldsymbol Y, \boldsymbol Z)$, proving the claim.

        We are left with the case where $\boldsymbol b$ is not saturated.
        We show that this is equivalent with a fractional capacitated $b$-matching problem on a path, which is bipartite and therefore shows that the solution is integral.

        As $\boldsymbol b$ is not saturated, there exists a terminal $i \in W$ such that
        \[
            D_{i-1,i} + D_{i,i+1} < b_i.
        \]
        By complementary slackness, we must have $\omega_i(e) = 0$.
        Construct now a new (fractional) $d'$-capacitated $b'$-matching problem on the graph $H'$ obtained from $H$ after `splitting' vertex $i$ (see Figure~\ref{fig:split}, which is much clearer than the formal difition in the next sentence).
        Thus, $H$ has vertex set $W\setminus \{i\} \cup \{i', i''\}$ and edge set $E(H') = E(H) \setminus \{ \{i-1,i\}, \{i, i+1\} \} \cup \{ \{i-1, i'\}, \{i'', i+1\} \}$.
        Set the connection capacities $d'_{i-1,i'} = d_{i-1,i}$, $d'_{i'',i+1} = d_{i,i+1}$ and $d'_{u,v} = d_{u,v}$ for pairs $uv$ not involving $i$, $i'$ or $i''$.
        Set the terminal capacities $b'_{i'} = b'_{i''} = \infty$ and $b'_j = b_j$ otherwise.

        \begin{figure}[h]
            \centering
            \includegraphics[width=.35\textwidth]{split}
            \caption{Construction of a new bipartite instance.} \label{fig:split}
        \end{figure}

        Note that the $(\boldsymbol \omega, \boldsymbol \psi)$ corresponds to a feasible dual solution $(\boldsymbol \omega', \boldsymbol \psi')$ in the constructed problem for $H'$, by setting $\omega'_{i'} = \omega'_{i''} = 0$.
        Note that the cost for both solutions are equal.
        We now argue that the constructed solution is optimal.
        We first observe that any optimal solution must have $\omega'_{i'} = \omega'_{i''} = 0$, as otherwise the objective becomes $\infty$.
        If there would exist a different solution with strictly smaller objective, this would correspond to a solution in the original problem with the same (strictly smaller) objective, contradicting optimality of $(\boldsymbol \omega, \boldsymbol \psi)$.
        Hence, $(\boldsymbol \omega', \boldsymbol \psi')$ is integral as $H'$ is bipartite, and hence $(\boldsymbol \omega, \boldsymbol \psi)$ is integral as well.
    \end{proof}

    The proof is useful as an extension of Lemma~4 from B\&O (for arbitrary $b$ and $d$).
    For the compact MIP formulation above, this proof shows that if we can assume $f$ is integral, then this implies that $\omega$ and $\psi$ are also integral.
    Also the reverse implication holds, as for fixed integer $\omega$ and $\psi$ the problem reduces to a multicommodity flow problem with integer capacities.
    This does not mean, however, that the whole formulation is integral.
    Indeed, there exist instances for which an integrality gap is present, even for the case where $b$ and $d$ are unit.
    These instances are the natural extension of integrality gap instances identified for the VPN problem.
    The largest integrality gap we found so far is using the graph with $4$ terminals in Figure~\ref{fig:gap4}, where the cycle is defined by unit $b$ and $d$.
    This instance gives an integrality gap of $9/8$, which is the same integrality gap as found for the VPN problem.
